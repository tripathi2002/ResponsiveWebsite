            The white-naped honeyeater (Melithreptus lunatus) is a passerine bird of the honeyeater family Meliphagidae
            native to eastern Australia. It dwells in dry eucalypt woodland with long periods of dryness and heat, with
            a diet consisting of nectar from various flowers, and it also feeds on insects. The species is classified as
            a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This white-naped honeyeater
            was photographed in Glen Davis, New South Wales.</p>

         <p class="secSubTag text-small">The word culture is derived from the Latin root cultura or cultus meaning to
            "inhabit, cultivate, or honour". In general, culture refers to human activity; different definitions of
            culture reflect different theories for understanding, or criteria for valuing human activity. Present day
            anthropologists use the term to refer to the universal human capacity to classify experiences and to encode
            and communicate them symbolically. They regard this capacity as a defining feature of the genus Homo. Since
            culture is learned, people living in different places have different cultures. There can be different
            cultures in different countries, and there can also be shared cultures among continents.</p>

         <p class="secSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as
            transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of
            understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical
            thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education
            results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a
            slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:
            the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of
            cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas
            such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational
            skills.</p>
